# Contacting us

If you have a question ("How do I", "Does ScalaPB support", "It doesn't work")
you are welcome to contact us over [ScalaPB Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/trueaccord/ScalaPB).

If you prefer email or less-interactive contact, you can post to [ScalaPB's
Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?nomobile=true#!forum/scalapb).

If you believe the question (or its answer) might be beneficial to many users
consider posting it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and tag it
with `scalapb`. @thesamet (the main author) gets notified when that happen.

If you have found a bug or have a feature request, please
[search our open Github issues](https://github.com/scalapb/ScalaPB/issues),
and if it is a new bug feel free to post a new issue. When posting a new
issue, please describe what are you trying to do, what you expect it to do,
and what unexpected things happen. Provide as much detail as possible and
include all relevant code so it is possible for us to reproduce the issue.
